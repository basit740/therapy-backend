			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Coping is the constant process of changing your thoughts and behaviors
				to manage the things that happen to you.Coping can be classified as
				productive (the good type of coping), or non-productive (the not so good
				type of coping), The experts refer to it as adaptive and maladaptive
				coping.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some people cope better than others, depending on a variety of factors
				such as circumstances, environment and maturity level. You already use
				some productive coping strategies, such as expressing your emotions when
				someone hurts you or keeping your cool when you should be really angry,
				or when you look for solutions when faced with a problem. it is a truth
				we all come to accept bad things will happen in life. Parent will get
				divorced, a loved one will get sick, someone will have a car accident, a
				job will be lost. Life can be unfair: challenges will arise.
			</p>
			<p>
				My Therapy Tool helps you learn and use additional coping strategies.
				Your Objective is to follow the steps and use the tools to figure out
				how you can function better in the meantime when faced with the things
				that bother you, or with the things that can happen and may lead to
				non-productive behaviors, and can often turn into more serious issues in
				a downward spiral. The reality is that many people do not get pulled
				aside and are shown how to cope better - it's usually at a crises point
				when such things are addressed.
			</p>
			<p>
				My Therapy Tool creates an instruction book based on your inputs and
				analysis that you are able to use at your own pace. The power and the
				magic are in the usage, and it works because it serves as a guide and as
				a reminder when we tend to forget important things. It can help you feel
				better, it can help you bounce back faster when things happen. The
				bigger and better you build it and the more progress you make, the more
				inspired you may become to find new ways to function even better. How
				you got to this point shouldn't really matter, as the saying goes: when
				the past comes knocking, don't answer, it has nothing new to tell you.
				And it's OK if you don not have all of the answers today, most will not.
